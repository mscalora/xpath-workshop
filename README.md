# XPath Workshop

## What is XPath Workshop?

XPath Workshop is a very small web site that allows testing of XPath expressions. I
created it because all of the other XPath expresin testers I found available lacked
one or two features I needed for the project I was working on. The first was the
abiity to specify a context under which to run the XPath expression. The second is
to clearly show the complete results of evavluating the expression with data types.
Many of the tools I found show only the results converted to a string.
